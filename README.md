# football-data-analysis

A repository for exploratory analysis of European football league data using SQL in Python.

### Dependencies

- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite
- pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

### Data

I utilized the ["European Soccer Database"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) from Kaggle. The database tracks fixture data from the 2008/09 season through to 2015/16, detailing over 25,000 matches and 11,000 players across 11 European top-flight leagues. There is also information about each of 296 teams, as well as player attributes originating from the FIFA video game series.

### Methodology

- Things to consider:

  1. What does the data look like?
  2. What is interesting about this data?
  3. What can we learn from the data?

- Data cleaning, visualization and analysis

### Questions Explored

1. Win/draw/loss percentage of each team, and goals scored and conceded home and away per season
2. Individual seasons with highest (and lowest) margin of victory by country; average margin of victory across 8 seasons for each country
3. Addressing the "eye test": Are left-footed players really more creative/technically gifted?
